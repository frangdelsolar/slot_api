# What is it about

This is a coding exercise to build a slot machine.
To make it work:

- Clone API repository, install dependencies and run "python manage.py runserver"
- Clone Frontend repository, install dependencies.
  - Create a .env and set a variable like this "REACT_APP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/" (make sure address matches whatever the python server is serving)
  - Run "npm run start"
